## Types of Health Insurance Claims

### Cashless Claims

In cashless claims, the insurer directly settles the bill with the hospital, and the policyholder doesn't need to pay upfront (except for non-payable items and amounts exceeding policy limits).

**Process Overview**:
1. Policyholder approaches network hospital with health card and ID proof
2. Hospital verifies policy details and sends pre-authorization request to TPA/insurer
3. TPA/insurer approves or denies the request based on policy terms
4. If approved, treatment proceeds with direct billing to insurer
5. Policyholder pays only for non-covered expenses
6. Hospital submits detailed bills to TPA/insurer for settlement

**Timeframes**:
- Emergency hospitalization: Notification within 24 hours
- Planned hospitalization: Pre-authorization 3-4 days in advance
- Pre-authorization processing: 4-6 hours for emergencies, 48 hours for planned procedures

### Reimbursement Claims

In reimbursement claims, the policyholder pays for treatment upfront and then seeks reimbursement from the insurer.

**Process Overview**:
1. Policyholder undergoes treatment and pays hospital bills
2. Policyholder submits claim form and supporting documents to TPA/insurer
3. TPA/insurer verifies documents and processes claim
4. Approved amount is transferred to policyholder's bank account

**Timeframes**:
- Claim submission: Within 15-30 days of discharge (varies by insurer)
- Processing time: 7-30 days after complete documentation
- Payment: 7-10 days after approval

### Domiciliary Hospitalization Claims

These claims cover treatments taken at home when the patient cannot be moved to a hospital or when hospital beds are unavailable.

**Requirements**:
1. Doctor's certification that hospitalization was necessary but not feasible
2. Minimum treatment duration of 3 consecutive days
3. Regular monitoring by qualified medical professional
4. Detailed treatment records

### Pre and Post Hospitalization Claims

Coverage for medical expenses incurred before and after hospitalization:
- Pre-hospitalization: Usually 30-60 days before admission

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Policy and Coverage

**Q: What is the difference between individual and family floater policies?**
A: An individual policy covers a single person with a dedicated sum insured, while a family floater provides coverage for multiple family members with a shared sum insured that can be utilized by any covered member.

**Q: How does a pre-existing disease affect my claim?**
A: Pre-existing diseases typically have a waiting period of 2-4 years (as specified in your policy) before claims related to them are covered. After completion of this waiting period, treatment for these conditions becomes eligible for claims.

**Q: What is a sub-limit in health insurance?**
A: Sub-limits are caps on specific expenses within your overall sum insured. Common sub-limits apply to room rent, specific treatments, or disease categories. For example, a policy may limit room rent to 1% of sum insured per day or cataract surgery to ₹40,000.

**Q: What is proportionate deduction?**
A: If you opt for a higher category room than your entitlement as per policy, the insurer may apply proportionate deductions on all associated expenses (except medicines and consumables) in the same ratio as the room rent exceeded the eligible limit.

**Q: How does co-payment work?**
A: Co-payment is a cost-sharing requirement where you pay a specific percentage of the claim amount (typically 10-20%) while the insurer pays the rest. This may be applicable to specific conditions, age groups, or hospitals as per policy terms.

### Claims Process

**Q: What is the difference between cashless and reimbursement claims?**
A: In cashless claims, the insurer directly settles the bill with the network hospital, and you only pay for non-covered expenses. In reimbursement claims, you pay the full amount upfront and then submit documents to the insurer for reimbursement.

**Q: How do I check if my hospital is in the network?**
A: You can check the insurer's website, mobile app, or call the customer care number to verify if your hospital is in the network. You can also ask the hospital's insurance desk if they have a tie-up with your specific insurer.

**Q: What documents are required for pre-authorization?**
A: Typically, you need the pre-authorization form (filled by hospital), treating doctor's advice, estimated cost sheet, policy details, patient ID proof, and relevant investigation reports diagnosing the condition.

**Q: How long does claim processing take?**
